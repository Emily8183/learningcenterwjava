# 🧠 Personal Portfolio & LeetCompare Tool

## 📌 Project Overview

This portfolio serves two main purposes:

1. **Learning Sharing**  
   It showcases my learning journey through personal projects, technical blogs, and LeetCode solutions.

2. **LeetCompare Tool(Work-in-progress)**  
   [LeetCompare](https://emily.brajk.me/leetcode/comparisons) is a LeetCode solution comparison tool to compare up to four LeetCode problems and their solutions side-by-side.  
   It helps learners:
   - Identify similar problem-solving patterns
   - Understand how small changes in constraints can lead to different approaches
